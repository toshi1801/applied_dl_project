# Detecting Cancer Metastases on Gigapixel Pathology Images

This project is implemented in 2 jupyter notebooks.
1. adl_project_main : Contains training and evaluation code.
2. adl_project_evaluate : Only for testing images on best selected model.

How to run these notebooks?

1. adl_project_main : This notebook was trained on a system with 32GB RAM. So, to make it executable on Colab, some changes were made. Like, training set is reduced from 2 to 1. If you want to use 2 images for training, please use a system with at least 32GB RAM.
2. adl_project_evaluate : No changes required, can be run easily.
